      1. Who We Are<br>
      Eventicko (referred to as "we," "us," or "our") operates this website. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or our data practices, you can contact us at [your-email@example.com] or by mail at [Your Street Address, City, Postcode, Country].<br><br>

      2. What Personal Data We Collect and Why<br>
      When you interact with our website, we collect certain information to provide our services effectively. We collect information you provide directly to us, such as your Name, Email Address, and Phone Number. We use this data to create your account, send you ticket confirmations, provide event updates, and communicate with you regarding your order or the event. We also collect your Billing Address for payment verification and to process your purchase. Please note that we do not directly store full payment card details; these are processed securely by our trusted third-party payment processors (like Stripe or PayPal) to complete your transactions, and we only receive a confirmation of payment from them.<br><br>

      In addition to the information you provide, we also collect some data automatically. This includes your IP Address, Browser Type, and Operating System, which are gathered for website security, to understand how our website is used, and to diagnose any technical issues. We also collect Usage Data, such as pages you've visited and the time you've spent on our site, to analyze website performance and improve your user experience; this data is typically aggregated and anonymized. Furthermore, we use Cookies and Similar Technologies to help our website function, remember your preferences, and understand website usage. You can find more details about this in our "Cookie Policy" section below.<br><br>

      3. How We Use Your Personal Data (Legal Basis)<br>
      We process your personal data based on specific legal grounds under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Our primary basis is the Performance of a Contract, meaning we process your name, email, billing address, and payment information to fulfill your ticket order and deliver the services you've requested, such as sending tickets and event information.<br><br>

      We also process data based on our Legitimate Interests, provided these interests do not override your rights and freedoms. This includes actions like ensuring the security and integrity of our website, preventing fraud, and continuously improving our services based on user behavior. We also use your data to respond to your inquiries and provide customer support. If we send you marketing communications, such as newsletters about upcoming events, we do so only with your explicit Consent, which you are free to withdraw at any time. Finally, we may process your data where required by a Legal Obligation, for instance, for tax purposes or to comply with other applicable laws.<br><br>

      4. How We Share Your Personal Data<br>
      We respect your privacy and only share your data in limited, necessary circumstances. Your payment information is securely shared with Third-Party Payment Processors (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) solely for the purpose of processing your transactions. We may also share necessary information, like your name and ticket type, with Event Organizers to facilitate your entry to an event or for event-specific communications. Additionally, we use Service Providers (like web hosting or analytics providers) who assist us in operating our website, and these providers are always bound by strict confidentiality agreements to protect your data. We do not sell your personal data to third parties.
